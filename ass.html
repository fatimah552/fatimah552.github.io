<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>All thanks to Almighty Allah that has always be with me from the one of my life.
<br>My achievement is overcoming the fear to face a competitive exam.
<br>Back then when i was in secondary school, my teacher told me they will be a spelling bee competitive examination.
<br>I started working hard in order to be one of the best student in the competitive examination.
<br>i do not know where to start from but i have the confidence that i can do it.
<br>I will not stagnate if i fail and i know how to maintain a stable mind whether it is a failure or success.
<br>I encourage myself and decided to make hay while the sunshine and i started reading very well for me to be fully prepared for the examination.
<br>There are lot of student that willing to be the best by going to the library and lending books there.
<br>The examination approach and i did my best but to my greatest surprise i came out in fly colours.
